🍌 Banana Leaf Disease Classification Using Deep Learning
👨‍💻 Author: Samuel Sitorus (2155301144)
📁 Project: Final Project on Computer Vision
🌿 Background
Banana plants (Musa spp.) are an important agricultural commodity in various regions. Although they have high economic and nutritional value, these plants are vulnerable to various diseases that can reduce yield and quality.

Currently, disease identification is still performed manually by farmers, which tends to be:

Subjective

Time-consuming

Often inaccurate

Therefore, the development of a deep learning-based classification system is carried out to help detect and classify banana leaf diseases quickly and accurately. This system is integrated into an Android application.

❓ Problem Statement
Farmers face difficulties in identifying banana plant diseases due to:

Limited access to accurate information

Lack of fast diagnostic tools

🎯 Project Objectives
To develop an automated classification system using deep learning capable of detecting four major types of banana leaf diseases.

🎁 Benefits
Provides fast and accurate detection of banana plant diseases

Helps farmers take quicker action
