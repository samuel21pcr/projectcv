## 🌿 Background

Banana plants (*Musa spp.*) are an important agricultural commodity in various regions. Although they have high economic and nutritional value, these plants are vulnerable to various diseases that can reduce yield and quality.

Currently, disease identification is still performed manually by farmers, which tends to be:

- Subjective  
- Time-consuming  
- Often inaccurate  

To address this, a **deep learning-based classification system** is developed to help detect and classify banana leaf diseases quickly and accurately. This system is integrated into an **Android application**.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Farmers face difficulties in identifying banana plant diseases due to:

- Limited access to accurate information  
- Lack of fast diagnostic tools  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

Develop an **automated classification system** using deep learning capable of detecting **four major types of banana leaf diseases**.

---

## 🎁 Benefits

- Provides fast and accurate detection of banana plant diseases  
- Helps farmers take timely action
